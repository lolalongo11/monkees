The Monkees band website: 

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Breif synopsis of website*/

This website is a HTML and CSS technology created site created using bootstrap, googleapis fonts and styles.
I have used Git and GitHub for version control.  

The site is to showcase the Monkees photographs, music, video, advertising gigs and event performances such as weddings and other parties that 
users may be interested in.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Social Media Links*/

Social links for the band that have been used in the project are their actual links.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UX - User experience*/

The website is aimed to fans old and new, for fans that want to be kept informed of the bands new music and tour dates, 
link to their social media, listen to the bands songs, see photos and generally keep in touch. 

Users can navigate the landing page index.html to the bands social media links and even sign up for new music and tours. From the landing page the user
can navigate to contact.html where they can sign up to book the band for events, they can navigate to listen.html where they can see the band video 
(header)
and listen to the band songs - 4 songs listed, the user can also navigate to gallery.html where they can see various photographs of the band. 

In designing the website I wrote up some rough ideas /Design_Process/monkees_plan1.jpg /Design_Process/monkees_plan2.jpg /Design_Process/monkees_plan3.jpg

The Assets of this project - music and photos were provided for by code institute. 
Since starting the project the links to the credit of who provided the Assets to CI have since been removed. 

I made sure the website had responsive design as part of the ux and looks good on mobile devices as well and tablets and laptops/pc. I have test the 
view of the responsive design by inspecting the page and then toggling between mobile and pc and it looks good. 
 
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Features and how they are expected to work*/

Index.html
This is the landing page that the user sees when they arrive. 
From here the user can navigate to the other sections of the project - contact, gallery and listen. 
The landing page also provides as previously mentioned the ability for the user to sign up for new music and tour dates before they are released
to the general public.
The bands social links are showcased on index.html and they point to the bands social media accounts. 

Contact.html
I kept the headers the same throughout the website for ease of navigating back to each section.
The contact.html page provides a form for the user to complete to sign up to book the band for events. 

Gallery.html
The photographs provided in the gallery were Assets provided by Code Institute for the milestone project. 
This area is where the user can click on a photo to enlarge it. 
I used the code from https://codepen.io/nebo/pen/ONXejO courtesy of nebo to style my gallery.html and css. 

Listen.html
The music in this section, 4 songs, were provided by Code Institute to be used on the milestone project. 
The user can listen to the bands songs by selecting the audio function on the page. 
The header I added by using code from bootstrap - https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/video-header/. 
Since the video that was provided in the project notes does not render I selected my own video to use: 

https://archive.org/download/Monkees_Im_A_Believer_Video 

Existing Features
Get in touch section - allows users to sign up by adding name and email to get placed on mailing list when new music and tour dates come out.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Future plans for enhancement*/

Plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
Features Left to Implement - online shop to sell band merchandise and additional styling to the songs on the listen.html page.
Another feature idea - a video.html page where users can see more of the bands music videos.
Technologies - future tech to use for a more creative website and better ux - JavaScript and Jquery.

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technologies used*/

The project uses HTML as the project main technology and CSS to style  
AWS as the project framework to create the files: Assets, CSS, Images, Video, Design_Process, contact.html, gallery.html, index.html, listen.html and
README.md
Git and GitHub are used for version control, I pushed my project from AWS to Github to save new features and code. 
I regularly saved my work and ensured it worked after it was saved each time. 

I conducted UAT after each push to GitHub and after each re login to AWs as well as once deployed.
I tested by individually selecting each feature and ensuring that the page was rendering correctly with all expected code working as intended. 

/* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UAT*/

UAT Script:

index.html
On the contact section to 'hear it first' make sure that the name and email are required before user can sign up. 
The social media links all work and direct the user to the correct sites.
All menu tabs such as Home, Contact, Gallery and Listen are working and directing the user to the correct area of the site and 
pointing to the intended section. 

contact.html
The contact form to sign up for band performances at weddings at other parties, make sure that the name, email and even details are
required before user can submit form. 
Ensured that the user can navigate back to each section of the website - home, gallery, listen. 

gallery.html 
The gallery page shows the photographs showcased with nice effects, and once the photos are clicked on they enlarge and are 
showcased in the center of the page. 

listen.html
Ensure that each of the 4 songs listed playback and download when clicking on the vertical ellipsis and that the option to download appears
the header works and that the video plays in the background - credit to The header I added by using code from bootstrap - https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/video-header/. 
Since the video that was provided in the project notes does not render I selected my own video to use: 
https://archive.org/download/Monkees_Im_A_Believer_Video 

/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Challenges*/

I found it difficult to resolve the problem of the original video provided for by code institure to work with my code,
although the video plays on my laptop it would not work when added to my code, this issue was reported by many other students on the course as shown in the slack pages for code institute. 
I found it quite confusing that the project layout and sylabus changed 2 weeks into the project. When I started creating the website there was a lot of information
on the project ideas section which was later removed to be made more generic. I was not able to link or give credit other than to mention CI and not the actual sources. 


/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Deployment*/

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

Photos in this site were obtained from Code institute project syllabus
Video in the listen.html page was used from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N9Lkpt6SrY and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvqeSJlgaNk

/*------------------------------------------------Acknowlegements*/

Inspiration for the layout of this project was taken from the resume mini project we did in the previous section. 
I roughly followed the outline and guidance of the 
material we learned in the resume mini project and took inspiration in the layout.

I used the code from https://codepen.io/nebo/pen/ONXejO courtesy of nebo to style my gallery.html and css. 

For help with the Audio element I went to https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp.
